export const CART_ADD_ITEM = 'CART_ADD_ITEM';
export const CART_REMOVE_ITEM = 'CART_REMOVE_ITEM';//NOTE: constant is equal to the same string literal

//QUESTION: is 'CART_ADD_ITEM' simply a string with no significance at this point?  Or is it defined somewhere I forgot where?
//QUESTION: why not just have all the constants in a single file?
